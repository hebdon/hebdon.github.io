North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC. The Department of Sociology and Anthropology is accepting applications for an assistant professor (tenure-track) appointment as a cultural anthropologist with a focus on medical anthropology to begin Fall 2021. Qualifications: Ph.D. in Anthropology by start date (anticipated 8/16/2021); strong record or promise of research and publication, including potential for obtaining extramural funding; strong commitment to student mentorship. Teaching load is two courses per semester for research active faculty. Candidates should be prepared to teach undergraduate and graduate courses. While specific research topic is open, geographic area of specialization must lie outside Latin America and candidates should have a strong background in ethnographic research. Priority will be given to candidates who can teach qualitative research methods, anthropological theory, and whose research complements existing program strengths by speaking to topics such as health disparities, environmental and occupational risk, physical trauma, as well as transnational aspects of illness and healthcare. The Anthropology program at NCSU values a holistic approach, and candidates with the ability to reach across sub-disciplinary boundaries are especially welcome.  Formal screening of applications will begin October 10, and will continue until the position is filled.
