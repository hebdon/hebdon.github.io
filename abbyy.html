<h2 id="orgd5922d6"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> What Use Do Humanists and Social Scientists Have For Searchable Databases?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Anthropology includes researchers who conducted a great variety of studies: from archaeological digs to primatological sits, ethnographic fieldworks to ecological assays, community-wide surveys to fine-grained interviews, and much more. Among the many things that unite all anthropologists, however, is that our fieldnotes and archives consist almost entirely of typewritten and handwritten documents. What also unites us is that the discipline has no popular theory about how to organize them in a way that uses computers. 
</p>

<p>
Infamously, upon completing a period of research anthropologists are intimidated by their stacks of notes &#x2014; not only because of worries about whether enough information has been collected in them, (and whether what was not documented is going to be able to be recalled to memory), but because the stack of different documents is simply unwieldy. Worse, stacks of field notes can become objects of prestige pointed at on the desk when colleagues visit, and, not long after, objects of avoidance buried somewhere out of sight and mind. What is lacked, on the whole, is a coordinated disciplinary strategy for making our fieldnotes accessible to ourselves right from the start: archivable, categorizable, searchable, editable, redundant, backupable, and transformable.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the biggest users of OCR technology in the social sciences and humanities is the legal profession &#x2014; for whom searching through and working with many documents not only makes intellectual, but also economic, cents! 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2166971" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2166971"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The File</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Famously, social scientists have written about how they traditionally deal with such problems with The File. Probably no resource is more optimistic than Appendix 1 of C. Wright Mills's <i>Sociological Imagination</i> titled "On Intellectual Craftsmanship". "By keeping an adequate file and thus developing self-reflective habits, you learn how to keep your inner world awake," Mills advised. In the way he understood it, The File was both a site to write into and a source to write out of. It was something that you organized in such a way that it could organize you, insofar as you attended to it in certain ways.
</p>

<p>
<i>Whenever you feel strongly about events or ideas you must try not to let them pass from your mind, but instead to formulte them for your files and in so doing draw out their implications, show yourself either how foolish these feelings or ideas are, or how they might be articulated into productive shape. The file also helps you build up the habit of writing. You cannot `keep your hand in' if you do not write something at least every week. In developing the file, you can experiment as a writer and thus, as they say, develop your powers of expression. To maintain a file is to engage in the controlled experience.</i> 
</p>

<p>
In this sense, Mills' idea of "the file" is that of a site of planning. The File should be both a journal into which your ideas go, and a surface off of which they bounch, as well as a place into which they are ordered, and of a source from which they are reinterpreted. 
</p>

<p>
<i>A practicing social scientist ought periodically to review `the state of my problems and plans'&#x2026;. Any working social scientist who is well on his [sic. inter alia] way ought at all times to have so many plans, which is to say ideas, that the question is always, which of them am I, ought I, to work on next? And he should always keep a special little file for his master agenda, which he writes and rewrites just for himself and perhaps or discussion with friends. From time to time he ought to review this very carefully and purposefully, and sometimes too, when he is relaxed&#x2026;. Some such procedure is one of the indispensable means by which your intellectual enterprise is kept oriented and under control</i>. (Mills 1956: 198)
</p>

<p>
Mills' recommendations can come off as intimidating, with his protestant ethic of The File. As he tells us towards the beginning, "It is best to begin, I think, by reminding you, the beginning student, that the most admirable thinkers within the scholarly community you have chosen to join to not split their work from their lives." (ibidem: 195) But this ideal is not &#x2014; let's be honest &#x2014; happening all the time for everyone. 
</p>

<p>
Another approach, less infamous but probably more widespread, is, as one professor once told me, after inquiring what they do with fieldnotes: "I burn them." Somewhere between the carefully filing of Mills, the nervous ignoring of stacks of papers on the desk, and the incineration of fieldnotes there has to be a compromise, and arguably even a synergistic approach that affords more of the goods and less of the bads of them all.

<div id="outline-container-org62cb292" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org62cb292"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The New <i>Corpus inscriptionum</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Malinowski once wrote about The File in other terms, as the ethnographic corpus, or corpus inscriptionum, the body of work accumulated from fieldwork. Today, the corpus has come to include an even wider variety of mediums and formats than in Malinowski's day. But now, much more than in Malinowski's time, our problem is not the availability of technology but the understanding, harnessing, and control of it, insofar as it can serve the ends of a disciplined and disciplining File of the kind Mills envisioned &#x2014; a self-reflexive and practical anthropological database. 
</p>

<p>
For students at faculty at most Anthropology departments in the United States, the organization of fieldnotes is a genuine problem, although one that is so individualized that it hardly, if ever, brought up. In part, this comes out of an assumption that fieldnotes are personal property, and not to be talked about too much. But this tacit assumption is detrimental. It would be better to frame fieldnotes as a dilemma for all, rather than as the jealous privation or private shame of each. What we need is a discipline-wide strategy for increasing the accessibility of fieldnotes for each and every departmental scholar. 
</p>

<p>
The New File, or the new corpus inscriptionum, then, could include this: a processing service provided free to all members of the department that scans fieldnotes of any size and shape into searchable PDF format. The key words in this are "free" and "searchable." Such services need to be free, in one sense, because every researcher, however budding or senior, could benefit from even the possibility of such a service. It would allow any researcher of any rank to have their fieldnotes &#x2014; whether typed into a computer, typed on a typewriter, or handwritten in one language or another &#x2014; digitized and provided to them in a folder that would then be searchable using Linux, Windows, Mac, Android or any other device. Such services need to be free, in a second sense, in terms of <i>libre</i> or freedom, as in not restricting the content or ability of users to take ownership of the means of their production of digitized materials. Such services also need to  provide searchability. The main thing that would be useful to all anthropologists is if their fieldnotes &#x2014; composed of a mish mash of inscribed objects &#x2014; could be digitized and made searchable. 
</p>

<p>
What does this imply in practice?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org17e63e7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org17e63e7"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Optical Character Recognition for Humanists and Social Scientists</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) has been around for nearly two decades, with the most important players in the market for OCR software being ABBYY, Adobe, Google, Microsoft, and Tesseract. All of these services are increasingly adding support for ICR, or Ink Character Recognition, which recognizes handwritten materials. The combinartion of OCR and ICR is the combo necessary for a great digitization program that is useful for anthropologists with our variety of collected materials. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd03624d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd03624d"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Adobe</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Adobe's premier software is Acrobat Pro. Acrobat is great for OCRing single PDF files, and even small batches, on Mac and Windows. The downsides of Acrobat are various, however. To use Acrobat, one needs a Creative Cloud account and license. Also, Adobe has its attention drawn in a thousand different directions with all the many Cloud apps that it is currently maintaining. While Acrobat is arguably the best PDF editor for Mac and Windows, it doesn't supply a Linux version, and its OCR is not the best. Nor does it currently support the recognition of handwritten text. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org874458a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org874458a"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Tesseract</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Tesseract is a free and open source OCR program, which currently lacks stock support for ICR. It can be run on Mac, Windows, Linux or other operating systems like FreeBSD and CentOS. While potentially powerful if trained on materials during preprocessing, Tesseract is a few years behind the technology of ABBYY, Adobe, and Google. It is, however, perhaps the best OCR technology for scholars who want a personalized and long term project to work on. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7ec7928" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7ec7928"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Google Cloud Vision OCR</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Google's Cloud Vision OCR has been shown in some academic articles to be among the top of the pack, outcompeting in its accuracy well-trained Tesseract engines, Adobe Acrobat, and ABBYY Finereader. While there are big promises for Google OCR in the coming years, currently the only way to access it is to sign up as a developer on Google Cloud, a not practical option for most people.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgba46d9d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgba46d9d"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> RECOMMENDED: ABBYY Finereader and OCR SDK</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
The best all around OCR and ICR software is that from ABBYY, which offers a version of its services for all desktop and mobile platforms. ABBYY is the only professional service that brings all of its power to Linux, and increasingly important feature for universities as more and more programmers move away from Microsoft and Apple operating systems. While Adobe and Google have their hands in a thousand different hats, ABBYY is a company dedicated entirely towards product development of high-quality OCR and ICR, including for complex documents. In practice this means that ABBYY OCR not has consistent quality at the top or near the top of its corporate and <i>libre</i> open source competitors, but that its software is designed specifically to do the task we have been discussing &#x2014; digitizing documents with high quality optical character and handwriting recognition. 
</p>

<p>
To boot, ABBYY has a few other features that are specially important for anthropologists. The newest releases of their software support more languages than any of their competitors, and this support encompasses multilingual documents (very common in anthropology). Additionally, they are offering student packages for free if you sign up for an account, a savings of at least two hundred dollars a year per person: <a href="http://www.ocrsdk.com">http://www.ocrsdk.com</a>

<h2 id="org54556f6"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Librenotes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Librenotes at this development stage will test the best engines for processing multilingual, complex format, and including handwritten, anthropological field notes and documents. 
</p>

<p>
It will be offering an option for Yale University Anthropology students to test the ABBYY Cloud OCR system. And it will also have another option that works by an ssh connection Yale's and Berkeley's custom Tesseract engine.
