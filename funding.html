About the Society

<p>
NOMINATION PROCEDURE
    Candidates are nominated for Junior Fellowships, generally by those under whom they have studied. Applications are not accepted from the candidates themselves. A letter of nomination should include an assessment of the candidate's work and promise, i.e. a full letter of recommendation, and also provide complete contact information for the candidate, including current residential address and email address, and the names, mailing addresses, and email addresses of three additional people who agree to write letters of recommendation by the date requested when they are contacted by the Society. Men and women interested in any field of study are eligible for these fellowships. Nominees should be of the highest calibre of intellectual achievement, i.e. comparable to the most successful candidates for junior faculty positions at leading universities.
</p>

<p>
Upon receipt of the mailed nomination, the Society will request letters of recommendation from the referees listed, and ask the candidate to submit samples of written work (dissertation chapters, articles, papers) along with a one or two-page proposal describing the studies he or she would like to pursue while a Junior Fellow: 
</p>

<p>
• The Society will request that the three additional letters of recommendation be submitted
   electronically - not by email, but through a link which we will provide in our correspondence with 
   the referees. After receipt of the nomination, the referees will be contacted by our office both by regular 
   mail and email and asked to submit their letters within three weeks of the date of our email. 
   (This is why full and accurate email addresses are necessary to process the nomination.) Instructions 
   for uploading letters will be provided to each referee, along with a password to enter the secure site.
</p>

<p>
• Our communication with the candidate will request that written materials be submitted both electronically 
   through a link to our submission portal and by mail or express mail within three weeks from the date of 
   our initial email contact. Full instructions for uploading the C.V., list of publications, research proposal, 
   and three samples of work will be provided, along with a password to enter the secure site.
</p>

<p>
• The candidate is requested to provide official transcripts of both undergraduate and graduate records. 
   (Ideally, transcripts should be forwarded directly to the Society from the universities involved; however, 
   candidates who have sealed transcripts may submit them with their mailed materials.) 
</p>

<p>
On the basis of the materials submitted, the Senior Fellows select a certain number of candidates for interview. It is from this number that the final selection is made. The Society pays the traveling expenses of those candidates interviewed.
</p>

<p>
Please note: If still pursuing the Ph.D., candidates should be at the dissertation stage of their theses and be prepared to finish their degrees within a year of becoming fellows. If already a recipient of the degree, they should not be much more than a year past the Ph.D. at the time the fellowship commences. Most Junior Fellows receive the Ph.D. just prior to the start of the fellowship.
</p>


<p>
     The deadline for receiving nominations for Junior Fellowships that begin July 1, 2018, is Friday, August 11, 2017. No nomination will be accepted with a postmark past the deadline. Nominations will not be accepted by email.
All letters should be sent to:

Academy Scholars Program
This program is open to all recent PhD recipients and doctoral candidates in the social sciences or law.
</p>

<p>
The Academy Scholars Program identifies and supports outstanding scholars at the start of their careers whose work combines disciplinary excellence in the social sciences or law with a command of the language and history or culture of countries or regions outside of the United States or Canada. Their scholarship may elucidate domestic, comparative, or transnational issues, past or present.
</p>

<p>
The Academy Scholars are a select community of individuals with resourcefulness, initiative, curiosity, and originality, whose work in cultures or regions outside of the US or Canada shows promise as a foundation for exceptional careers in major universities or international institutions.
</p>

<p>
Academy Scholars are appointed for a two-year, in-residence, postdoctoral fellowship at The Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. They receive substantial financial and research assistance to undertake sustained projects of research and/or acquire accessory training in their chosen fields and areas. The Senior Scholars, a distinguished group of senior Harvard University faculty members, act as mentors to the Academy Scholars to help them achieve their intellectual potential.
</p>

<p>
Eligibility
The competition for these awards is open only to recent PhD (or comparable professional school degree) recipients and doctoral candidates in the social sciences or law.
</p>

<p>
Those still pursuing a PhD should have completed their routine training and be well along in the writing of their theses before applying to become Academy Scholars. If you have completed a PhD program, the PhD completion date must be within three years of the October 1 application deadline. For applicants applying for the October 1, 2018 deadline, you must have completed your PhD or equivalent after September 30, 2015.
</p>

<p>
The Selection Committee considers all applicants in one applicant pool.
</p>

<p>
Terms
Each year, four to five Academy Scholars are named for two-year appointments. Academy Scholars are expected to reside in the Cambridge/Boston area for the duration of their appointments unless traveling for pre-approved research purposes.
</p>

<p>
Postdoctoral Academy Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $67,000. If selected before earning the PhD, the Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $31,000 until awarded the PhD. This stipend is supplemented by funding for conference and research travel, research assistants, and health insurance coverage. Some teaching is permitted but not required.
</p>

<p>
Applications are welcome from qualified persons without regard to nationality, gender, or race
</p>

<p>
How to Apply
All application materials need to be submitted by the deadline of October 1. We do not accept late applications.
</p>

<p>
The completed application will include:
</p>

<p>
Cover letter which succinctly states the applicant's academic field, country or region of specialization, and proposed research topic
Curriculum vitae (CV) or resumé; including list of publications
Research proposal (2500 word maximum); including intellectual objectives and planned methodological and disciplinary work
A copy of your PhD program transcript
Three letters of recommendation (uploaded through the online application)
Letters should be addressed to the "Selection Committee."
Letters of recommendation need to be uploaded by the deadline of October 1.
</p>

<p>
All parts of the application, including the three letters of recommendation, are submitted online as pdf documents. The online application is accessed through the homepage of The Harvard Academy’s website. To access the application, click on the APPLY ONLINE button.
</p>

<p>
Questions should be emailed to:
applicationinquiries@wcfia.harvard.edu.
</p>

<p>
You may include footnotes, endnotes, and/or bibliographies in your proposed research statement, but they are not required. If you do give references, they will not count towards the 2500-word maximum for the research statement.
</p>

<p>
We require no copies of published papers or abstracts as part of our application process. Do not include them in your application.
</p>

<p>
Regarding transcripts from foreign universities: our reviewers read many applications from those at foreign universities and request as much transcript-like official documentation as the Registrar at your university can provide, for all graduate work—both for the Master's and PhD programs in which you have been or are currently enrolled. Your institution most likely gets these requests often and can provide the required paperwork to you upon request.

Activities
The Society of Fellows is an interdisciplinary intellectual community in which the postdoctoral Fellows are joined by Senior Fellows to share their work in progress.

Each Fellow may draw on the Society’s funds for research or travel on approval from the Chair and with proper receipts, up to a total of $1500 per year. Fellows are encouraged to seek support from external agencies if it appears that their scholarly and creative work will be enhanced by such grants.

The appointed fellows will enjoy full use of such college resources as the library, computing center, the Leslie Center for the Humanities, Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Dickey Center for International Understanding, the Hood Museum of Art, and the Hopkins Center.
</p>

<p>
The 2018-2020 fellows received an annual stipend of $57,528 plus benefits, an annual research allowance of $2,000, and a first-year-only computer allowance of $2,500. The terms for the 2019-2021 fellows will be similar.

THE HARRY FRANK GUGGENHEIM FOUNDATION
</p>

<p>
General Guidelines for Submitting Applications for Dissertation Fellowships
</p>

<p>
In addition to the foundation's program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or
more dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would
complete the writing of a dissertation within the award year. 
</p>

<p>
These fellowships of $20,000 each are designed to contribute to the support of the
doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a timely manner and are
only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work. 
</p>

<p>
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in
comparison with each other and not in competition with the postdoctoral research grant
proposals. Applicants may be citizens of any country and studying at colleges or
universities in any country. 
</p>

<p>
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to
social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among
other subjects. Dissertations with no relevance to understanding human violence and
aggression will not be supported. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies
not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.
</p>

<p>
Eligibility
</p>

<p>
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of
graduate school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and
writing has begun. If analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be
confident that he will complete the dissertation within the year, he should not apply, as
the application will not be competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some
disciplines, particularly experimental fields, research and writing can reasonably be
expected to be completed within the same year, and in those cases it is appropriate to
apply.
</p>

<p>
Timing
</p>

<p>
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be received by February 1, for a
decision in June. Applications are reviewed during the spring and final decisions are
made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June. Applicants will be informed
promptly by e-mail as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards ordinarily commence
on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the nature of
the project makes this appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Final Report
</p>

<p>
Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved
and accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any
papers, books, articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to
the foundation.
</p>

<p>
Application
</p>

<p>
Applications are submitted online. (However, we will still accept a mailed application using
our previous application method, a printable PDF form, provided it arrives at the
foundations office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if February 1
falls on a weekend.) Applicants will first create a login account and will then be able to
access detailed guidelines and the online application. Applicants can also view the
guidelines only, without logging in and without starting an application, through the second
link below.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-5-1-4-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Josephine de Karman Fellowship Trust was established in 1954 by the late Dr. Theodore von Karman, world renowned aeronautics expert and teacher and first director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, in memory of his sister, Josephine, who died in 1951. The purpose of this fellowship program is to recognize and assist students whose scholastic achievements reflect Professor von Karman's high standards.</li>
<li>DeKarman fellowships are open to PhD students in any discipline,including international students, who are <b>currently enrolled</b> in a university located within the United States. <b>Only PhD candidates who will defend their dissertation in or about June 2020 are eligible for consideration for a 2019-2020 fellowship</b>. Undergraduate students, master's degree students, and postdoctoral scholars are not eligible for consideration. Special consideration will be given to applicants in the Humanities.</li>
<li>Potential applicants should note that the <b>competition for DeKarman fellowships is extreme</b>. For the 2018-2019 cycle, the committee reviewed over 400 applications and awarded seven (7) fellowships. To be competitive, graduate applicants should have outstanding letters of recommendation, significant early scholarly contributions, and have completed several chapters of the dissertation at the time of application. Although the competition is open to graduate students from any US university, the vast majority of awards go to students at top-tier schools.</li>
<li>By the end of December following completion of their fellowship year, awardees are required to submit a current abstract of their dissertation and a one or two-page report on their achievements as a result of having held a Josephine de Karman Fellowship. The report should include a brief breakdown of how funds were utilized. This should be in the form of a letter to the Josephine de Karman Fellowship Committee, P.O. Box 3389, San Dimas, CA 91773.</li>
