THE HARRY FRANK GUGGENHEIM FOUNDATION
</p>

<p>
General Guidelines for Submitting Applications for Dissertation Fellowships
</p>

<p>
In addition to the foundation's program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or
more dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would
complete the writing of a dissertation within the award year. 
</p>

<p>
These fellowships of $20,000 each are designed to contribute to the support of the
doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a timely manner and are
only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work. 
</p>

<p>
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in
comparison with each other and not in competition with the postdoctoral research grant
proposals. Applicants may be citizens of any country and studying at colleges or
universities in any country. 
</p>

<p>
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to
social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among
other subjects. Dissertations with no relevance to understanding human violence and
aggression will not be supported. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies
not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.
</p>

<p>
Eligibility
</p>

<p>
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of
graduate school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and
writing has begun. If analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be
confident that he will complete the dissertation within the year, he should not apply, as
the application will not be competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some
disciplines, particularly experimental fields, research and writing can reasonably be
expected to be completed within the same year, and in those cases it is appropriate to
apply.
</p>

<p>
Timing
</p>

<p>
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be received by February 1, for a
decision in June. Applications are reviewed during the spring and final decisions are
made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June. Applicants will be informed
promptly by e-mail as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards ordinarily commence
on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the nature of
the project makes this appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Final Report
</p>

<p>
Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved
and accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any
papers, books, articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to
the foundation.
</p>

<p>
Application
</p>

<p>
Applications are submitted online. (However, we will still accept a mailed application using
our previous application method, a printable PDF form, provided it arrives at the
foundations office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if February 1
falls on a weekend.) Applicants will first create a login account and will then be able to
access detailed guidelines and the online application. Applicants can also view the
guidelines only, without logging in and without starting an application, through the second
link below.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-1-4-1-0-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Josephine de Karman Fellowship Trust was established in 1954 by the late Dr. Theodore von Karman, world renowned aeronautics expert and teacher and first director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, in memory of his sister, Josephine, who died in 1951. The purpose of this fellowship program is to recognize and assist students whose scholastic achievements reflect Professor von Karman's high standards.</li>
<li>DeKarman fellowships are open to PhD students in any discipline,including international students, who are <b>currently enrolled</b> in a university located within the United States. <b>Only PhD candidates who will defend their dissertation in or about June 2020 are eligible for consideration for a 2019-2020 fellowship</b>. Undergraduate students, master's degree students, and postdoctoral scholars are not eligible for consideration. Special consideration will be given to applicants in the Humanities.</li>
<li>Potential applicants should note that the <b>competition for DeKarman fellowships is extreme</b>. For the 2018-2019 cycle, the committee reviewed over 400 applications and awarded seven (7) fellowships. To be competitive, graduate applicants should have outstanding letters of recommendation, significant early scholarly contributions, and have completed several chapters of the dissertation at the time of application.
