The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale invites applications for Academic Year 2019 – 2020 fellowships for language study. All foreign languages are eligible for funding.  However, applicants interested in studying Chinese, Japanese, or Korean should first apply to the Richard U. Light Fellowship Program; and, applicants interested in studying an eligible European language should first apply to the Council on European Studies’ Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships (FLAS) competition. The MacMillan Center will consider applications for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean or eligible European languages only from applicants who have been waitlisted for funding in the Light Program or the FLAS competitions. Applicants may not apply for or hold Light or FLAS fellowships concurrently with a MacMillan Center language fellowship.
</p>

<p>
Academic year language fellowships are available to any undergraduate, graduate and professional school student whose academic program requires the study of a foreign language or whose research plans require the study of a foreign language. In the application, students are expected to demonstrate a bona fide academic need to study the language they have proposed and show a clear relationship to the applicant’s overall course of study. Only current students who are fully enrolled may apply.
</p>

<p>
Priority will be given to students applying for intermediate and advanced level language study, but beginning level study will be considered from Ph.D. students who have a research need for the language.
</p>

<p>
Language courses for reading knowledge are not eligible for funding.
</p>

<p>
The academic year language fellowship provides up to $18,000 toward non-Yale University tuition and fees and up to $15,000 for living expenses.  Yale students may apply the award to recognized intensive programs at other universities within or outside the U.S. Rigorous online and distance education programs are also eligible for fellowship support.

</p>

<p>
Application Procedures
</p>

<p>
Applicants must submit hard copies of the following documents in English, or
accompanied by an English translation: 
</p>

<p>

THE HARRY FRANK GUGGENHEIM FOUNDATION
</p>

<p>
General Guidelines for Submitting Applications for Dissertation Fellowships
</p>

<p>
In addition to the foundation's program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or
more dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would
complete the writing of a dissertation within the award year. 
</p>

<p>
These fellowships of $20,000 each are designed to contribute to the support of the
doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a timely manner and are
only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work. 
</p>

<p>
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in
comparison with each other and not in competition with the postdoctoral research grant
proposals. Applicants may be citizens of any country and studying at colleges or
universities in any country. 
</p>

<p>
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to
social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among
other subjects. Dissertations with no relevance to understanding human violence and
aggression will not be supported. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies
not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.
</p>

<p>
Eligibility
</p>

<p>
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of
graduate school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and
writing has begun. If analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be
confident that he will complete the dissertation within the year, he should not apply, as
the application will not be competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some
disciplines, particularly experimental fields, research and writing can reasonably be
expected to be completed within the same year, and in those cases it is appropriate to
apply.
</p>

<p>
Timing
</p>

<p>
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be received by February 1, for a
decision in June. Applications are reviewed during the spring and final decisions are
made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June. Applicants will be informed
promptly by e-mail as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards ordinarily commence
on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the nature of
the project makes this appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Final Report
</p>

<p>
Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved
and accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any
papers, books, articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to
the foundation.
</p>

<p>
Application
</p>

<p>
Applications are submitted online. (However, we will still accept a mailed application using
our previous application method, a printable PDF form, provided it arrives at the
foundations office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if February 1
falls on a weekend.) Applicants will first create a login account and will then be able to
access detailed guidelines and the online application. Applicants can also view the
guidelines only, without logging in and without starting an application, through the second
link below.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-1-4-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Josephine de Karman Fellowship Trust was established in 1954 by the late Dr. Theodore von Karman, world renowned aeronautics expert and teacher and first director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, in memory of his sister, Josephine, who died in 1951. The purpose of this fellowship program is to recognize and assist students whose scholastic achievements reflect Professor von Karman's high standards.</li>
<li>DeKarman fellowships are open to PhD students in any discipline,including international students, who are <b>currently enrolled</b> in a university located within the United States. <b>Only PhD candidates who will defend their dissertation in or about June 2020 are eligible for consideration for a 2019-2020 fellowship</b>. Undergraduate students, master's degree students, and postdoctoral scholars are not eligible for consideration. Special consideration will be given to applicants in the Humanities.</li>
<li>Potential applicants should note that the <b>competition for DeKarman fellowships is extreme</b>. For the 2018-2019 cycle, the committee reviewed over 400 applications and awarded seven (7) fellowships. To be competitive, graduate applicants should have outstanding letters of recommendation, significant early scholarly contributions, and have completed several chapters of the dissertation at the time of application. Although the competition is open to graduate students from any US university, the vast majority of awards go to students at top-tier schools.</li>
<li>By the end of December following completion of their fellowship year, awardees are required to submit a current abstract of their dissertation and a one or two-page report on their achievements as a result of having held a Josephine de Karman Fellowship. The report should include a brief breakdown of how funds were utilized. This should be in the form of a letter to the Josephine de Karman Fellowship Committee, P.O. Box 3389, San Dimas, CA 91773.</li>
