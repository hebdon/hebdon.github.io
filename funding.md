### *de Karmen Fellow Trust*

1.  About the Josephin de Karman Fellowships

    -   The Josephine de Karman Fellowship Trust was established in 1954 by the late Dr. Theodore von Karman, world renowned aeronautics expert and teacher and first director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, in memory of his sister, Josephine, who died in 1951. The purpose of this fellowship program is to recognize and assist students whose scholastic achievements reflect Professor von Karman's high standards.
    -   DeKarman fellowships are open to PhD students in any discipline,including international students, who are **currently enrolled** in a university located within the United States. **Only PhD candidates who will defend their dissertation in or about June 2020 are eligible for consideration for a 2019-2020 fellowship**. Undergraduate students, master's degree students, and postdoctoral scholars are not eligible for consideration. Special consideration will be given to applicants in the Humanities.
    -   Potential applicants should note that the **competition for DeKarman fellowships is extreme**. For the 2018-2019 cycle, the committee reviewed over 400 applications and awarded seven (7) fellowships. To be competitive, graduate applicants should have outstanding letters of recommendation, significant early scholarly contributions, and have completed several chapters of the dissertation at the time of application. Although the competition is open to graduate students from any US university, the vast majority of awards go to students at top-tier schools.
    -   By the end of December following completion of their fellowship year, awardees are required to submit a current abstract of their dissertation and a one or two-page report on their achievements as a result of having held a Josephine de Karman Fellowship. The report should include a brief breakdown of how funds were utilized. This should be in the form of a letter to the Josephine de Karman Fellowship Committee, P.O. Box 3389, San Dimas, CA 91773.

2.  Application Materials:

    -   Unofficial transcripts of your graduate and undergraduate studies.
